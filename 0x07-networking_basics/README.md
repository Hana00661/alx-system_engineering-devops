OSI Model in a Nutshell:
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that describes how network devices communicate with each other. It essentially breaks down the complex process of network communication into seven distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility.

Key facts about the OSI model:
Number of Layers: 7 layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application)
Organization: Each layer interacts with the layer above and below it, and they work together to achieve network communication.
Function: Each layer has a specific function, providing services to the layer above and building upon the services of the layer below.
Conceptual Framework: Not a strict protocol, but a reference model for understanding and building compatible network systems.
Layers of the OSI Model:
Physical Layer: Deals with the physical transmission of data over cables or wireless signals. (e.g., cables, connectors, network cards)
Data Link Layer: Ensures reliable data transmission between adjacent devices. (e.g., MAC addresses, error detection, flow control)
Network Layer: Routes data packets through the network to the correct destination. (e.g., IP addresses, routing protocols)
Transport Layer: Provides reliable data transfer between applications on different devices. (e.g., TCP, UDP, connection management)
Session Layer: Manages communication sessions between applications. (e.g., session establishment, termination)
Presentation Layer: Handles data format conversion and encryption/decryption. (e.g., data compression, encryption)
Application Layer: Provides network services directly to applications. (e.g., HTTP, FTP, email)
Remember: The OSI model is a foundational concept for understanding network communication. While actual network protocols might not strictly follow all seven layers, it provides a valuable framework for troubleshooting and understanding how different network components work together.
